# Lab 1 Bonus

## Framework Choice: Express.js

I chose **Express.js** for this project because it is **simple**, **lightweight**, and widely used in the Node.js ecosystem. (and I also have some experience working with it)

## Best Practices Implemented

### Project Structure

I implemented an MVC structure for better maintainability:

- `app/` contains the core application logic
  - `controllers/` handles request logic
  - `views/` contains HTML templates
  - `routes/` manages API routes
  - `utils/` contains reusable utility functions.

### Clean Code and Comments

Modular functions, consistent naming, clear comments. Great for maintainability.

## Features

- Displays the current time in Moscow.
- Updates the time upon page refresh.

Manually tested.
