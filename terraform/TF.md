## Yandex

First, I installed Yandex Cloud command line interface and configured account.

Create service account

```bash
yc iam service-account create --name devops-terraform
```

Provide permissions to service account

```bash
yc resource-manager cloud add-access-binding ****iddasr4eplp --role editor --subject serviceAccount:****ko6shul5bncb
```

Create authorized key for service

```bash
yc iam key create \
  --service-account-id ****ko6shul5bncb \
  --folder-name default \
  --output key.json
```

Create profile

```bash
yc config profile create devops-terraform
```

Now, after a few more simple steps, it's time to create a VM.
I've decided to pick terraform1 with 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of RAM and found Ubuntu-22 image (id fd80bm0rh4rkepi5ksdi) with the following command:

```bash
yc compute image list --folder-id standard-images | grep ubuntu-22
```

```bash
terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
```
